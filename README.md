This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app allows users to add/remove/update tv shows and movies which they have seen or are currently watching. The goal is for users to have a place where they can keep all the data about the shows they watch including tracking viewing progress, user ratings and sorting by various attributes. You can try this app out at: portfolio link here.

Future features for this app are to add imdb api functionality, so that users can add real tv shows and movies from imdbs large database. I'd also like to implement some sort of user profile feature, so that different users can share their tracked shows with other users.
